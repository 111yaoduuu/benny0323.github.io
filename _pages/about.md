# 😉 About Me
I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying computer science and technology at [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm) where I am advised by [Prof. Ruiquan Ge](https://faculty.hdu.edu.cn/jsjxy/grq/main.htm) and [Prof. Changmiao Wang](https://www.sribd.cn/teacher/505). And I plan to pursue my master's degree at the Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn), Nanjing, and also with the [Key Laboratory of New Generation Artificial Intelligence Technology and Its Interdisciplinary Applications (Southeast University)](https://aiia.seu.edu.cn), Ministry of Education, China, advised by [Prof. Yikun Zhang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/yikun/main.htm) specialized in **SAM And Diffusion Model-Based CT Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR)**.

I have a broad interest in deep learning models, with a primary focus on Medical Image Analysis and Generative Models. I am also an enthusiastic self-learner and interested in various fields of computer science.
